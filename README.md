# monopolySim
Deducts the best property set to own in Monopoly based on game simulations.

This code does not perfectly simulate the real monopoly game since there is no trading going on between players, which is a big part of the real world monopoly game. I also descided to leave out the electric and the water company since I don't think they are that important. Also there is no jail time in this simulation since I didn't see how that would change the result in any way.

I experimented with many different data gathering systems but ultimately figured this is the best one. It tells you, how likely a player was to win, when they got to buy the complete set of a given propertycolor (see the pictures in this repo).
